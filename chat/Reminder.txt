~ Hey SME team ~
~ I have listed down a few things down here ~
~ You can add/ask questions her too ~

1. I have listed down the common commands below. Just use it for future reference (Please do edit it if found new and better commands)

        git fetch
        git pull origin master/main
        git branch

        git checkout *existing branch from remote*
        git checkout -b new_branch_locally

        -- staging area --
        git status
        git add .  --> This will add ALL the files to be pushed
        git commit -m "short description about the changes"
        git push origin {worked branch name}


        -- merging --
        git checkout main
        git merge {worked branch} -- remote repository
        git push origin master 

        -- 
        git push -u origin feature

2. Node_module will be in .gitignore (we don't want to bloat the GitHub with node_modules which are heavy as f***)

3. I still don't understand why we need to create a PROJECT instead of normal REPOSITORY

4. WE WILL BE CREATING PULL REQUEST TO 01_develop branch NOT main branch

5. ~~~~~~
